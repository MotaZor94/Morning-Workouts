    <h1>Trending Ways to Use Color in Web<br>Design</h1>
  
    <section class="intro">
      <p><strong>Color is a staple design element</strong> we see everywhere in our lives such as on every website we visit or app we use. The thing is, each year we see a lot of <a href="https://designmodo.com/web-design-trends-2018/">design trend predictions</a> and they never fail to include color.</p>

      <p>Over time, <a href="https://designmodo.com/color-scheme-generators/" data-wpel-link="internal">designers have used color</a> more boldly and more strategically. Sometimes it is used to give a specific element more attention, sometimes to tell a better story and sometimes to enhance the brand experience.</p>

      <p>Let’s talk about some of those examples.</p>
    </section>

      <h2>Create a Strong Background</h2>
      <p>A few years back there was a tremendous trend of <span>bold backgrounds</span>. I still see examples like that today. In a good design, a colorful and powerful background can be a good move to <strong>give interest to a specific section</strong>. Whatever your opinion on trends may be, we can agree that when done well, a good background color can help a section stand out.</p>

      <p>Let’s start with <a href="https://rootstudio.co.uk/">Root Studio</a> and how the design uses a yellow background to highlight its case study about the Chester Zoo. The yellow background helps set the tone for the case study. In addition to the minimalist design style, the background color is an important design element. Not all of their case studies use vibrant colors like the Chester Zoo yellow and that's okay. <strong>You don’t have to use a vibrant hue to make something stand out.</strong> This design wouldn’t work so well if the case study sections weren’t minimalistic either.</p>

      <p>Next, is <a href="http://mambomambo.ca/">Mambo Mambo</a> which uses color to highlight different sections of the portfolio as well. Some sections are neon yellow, deep blue and even black. In the screenshot you can see that the neon yellow is paired with greens, blues black and skin tones; they work in harmony.</p>
    
      <p>In this whole page, it’s the background colors that help make these sections unique and interesting. It’s also good branding for the agency.</p>

      <h2>Make a Statement</h2>
      
      <p>Other times, color can be used to make a bold statement. Let’s start with the <a href="http://ubersignlanguage.com/">Uber sign language landing page</a>. The orange gradient background definitely catches your attention. This is a great design strategy since the purpose of the page is to teach people basic sign language which relies on visual cues.</p>

      <p>Next, is <a href="https://kickpush.co/">Kickpush design studio portfolio</a>. As you read the copy, notice they have a different kind of personality. Kickpush wants to show they are different and the chosen color scheme helps do this. It is purposeful and makes a quick visual statement.</p>

      <p>This is also a good example of <span>branding</span> that we’ll talk about later.</p>
